    <h1 id="demo"><b>AltSchool student</b></h1>
    <p>My name is Mercy Gatwiri a student at Alt School, School of Engineering 2024
        My student ID is ALT/SOE/024/5523
        I'm 25 years old born,raised and residing in Nairobi Kenya.
    </p>
    <p>I fell in love with technology while in highschool during computer lessons when we had to visit the computer lab to learn how a computer works.I was truly fascinated and wanted to know more.I wanted to pursue a career in technology but my parents wanted me to pursue a more traditional course in University so i pursued a degree in Human Resourse Management. I still was obsessed with computers so i sought Youtube and i began learning how to code which wasn't easy and i began wondering if truly this was the path for me. </p>
    <p>Untill i met Alt School via social media and what completly drew me in was the glowing praise from its alumni which made me sign up.I knew i needed a community if i were to be succesful in the Tech industry since i had experienced how it get hard learning individually with Youtube. I also loved how the classes were very much flexible since im working full time also and so far the school has proven i made the right decision</p> <br><br>
    <p>My goals for Alt School are <ol> <li>Became a full stack developer</li>
        <li>Make a name in the technology world</li>
        <li>Develop systems to help women around the world completly free </li>
        <li>Network with other lovers of technology</li>
</ol></p> <br>
